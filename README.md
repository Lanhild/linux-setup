# What is this?

This repository is a script that can be used to automatically reinstall various configuration files for the KDE and XFCE desktop environments.



## Support

Currently, it only supports:

> KDE
> 
> XFCE


# Variables

Variables shouldn't need to be modified, as I adapted them to the 2 DE's, which is what makes the script compatible with the two environments.
