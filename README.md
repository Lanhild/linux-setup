# What is this?

This repository is a script that can be used to automatically reinstall various configuration files for the KDE and XFCE desktop environments.



## Support

Currently, it only supports:

> KDE
> 
> XFCE

## Other uses

This repository also contains a wallpapers collection. This means that the script is also capable of automatically adding wallpapers to the DE.

---

You can choose to wether install these wallpapers or not, and you can also use the wallpapers script to install whatever wallpapers you add to it, atleast as it is in the appropriate path.



# Variables

Variables shouldn't need to be modified, as I adapted them to the 2 DE's, which is what makes the script compatible with the two environments.
